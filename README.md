# Original README

C12.22 stack and tools readme, release 0.1c March 20, 2009


Original developer: ITRON, Liberty Lake, WA, USA


## 1.0 General

The stack implements the January 30, 2008 version of the C12.22 standard.  This is *NOT* the final version of the standard which is being published in March 2009.  The stack also has support for receiving messages in March 2006 C12.22 standard format.  If such a message is received, the stack will respond using the same version of the protocol.
  
See "Known Problems" section below.

The stack includes C code for application, transport, and datalink layers.  In addition, two different "physical" layers are included which provide interface to a PC serial port and to a "test link" that allows two stacks in the same PC application to communicate.

In addition to the C12.22 stack several test tools are included that
1) demonstrate how to use the stack
2) provide a meter simulation on a PC that can be interrogated via C12.22 over TCP/IP
3) provide a meter simulation on a PC that communicates serially to a comm module simulation on a PC that allows the meter to be interrogated via C12.22 over TCP/IP
4) allow checking CRC and encryption implementation

### 3.2 Test tools
    All of the test tools are Windows command line applications, and are built using 
    Borland C++ 5.02.  Most use the test library.  Most use the stack.  Some of the test tools
    provide usage help if they are run with no parameters.
    
    In C1222TEST, SIMPLESERIALDEVICE, and SIMPLETCPIPCOMMMODULE, the app shows some status info once a
    second or so in its window.  R= count of link resets; AS= application state (2=good); 
    TS= transport state (2=good), RP=received packets, TP=transmitted packets.  
    Each also has a number that is shown that is related to time.
    
    The listed IDE defines are the ones currently defined in the Borland IDE provided.

## 4.0 Known problems and other release notes

### 4.1 Known problems  
  1.    Implemented standard in the provided source is the January 30, 2008 version.  As of March 20, 2009 the C12.22 standard will be published this month.  The published version has a number of differences from the January 30, 2008 version.  We needed the standard to be finished before updating the submission to support it.
        
  2.    Stack does not handle a renegotiate response (0x09).
    
  3.    Provided code for local port routing has not had significant test.
  
  4.    Short message support is ifdefed out and untested.
  
### 4.2 Other release notes
  1.    Timing for the stack is provided by calls to C1222Misc_IsrIncrementFreeRunningTime which pass the elapsed time in milliseconds.  It should be called frequently - like every 1, 2, 5, 10, 100 ms or so. It does not need to be called at a consistent frequency.
  2.    The stack is single threaded.  Messages are sent by calling C1222Stack_SendMessage. C1222Stack_Run should be called frequently.  After running the stack check for message reception using C1222Stack_IsMessageAvailable. If a message is available call C1222Stack_GetReceivedMessage.  When done using a message, notify the source stack using C1222Stack_NoteReceivedMessageHandlingIsComplete or C1222Stack_NoteReceivedMessageHandlingFailed.
  3.    Look at C1222TEST for an example of how to use the stack. 
  4.    C12.22 device handles registration (there is some code in the comm module source to handle registration).  The device notifies the comm module that it should not perform registration in two ways.  First in the get config response, the "auto-registration" bit will always be clear.  Secondly, whenever the transport layer interface status indicates that auto-registration is on, it sends a transport layer link control request to the comm module to disable auto-registration.
  5.    Before the device becomes C12.22 registered, its transport configuration has a zero length node aptitle (0x0d 0x00).
  6.    When the device becomes C12.22 registered, it notifies the comm module(CM) to get its configuration using a link control request.  The configuration provided will include the registered aptitle of the meter in the node aptitle field.  This is the mechanism used to let the CM know the device's aptitle so it can know its own aptitle.
  7.    When the device receives a C12.22 deregister request/response (depending on the originator or the request being the a local procedure 24 or a deregister request received from the LAN) it returns its aptitle to zero length (0x0d 0x00), sets its registered state to false, and restarts the normal registration process.  The CM is also notified to get its configuration.
  8.    The native address in the transport configuration and in the transport layer send message is a 6 byte array of unsigned char (binary) instead of being a "STRING" as stated in the 1/30/2008 standard.  Latest version of the standard has changed the definition of native address as being binary.
  9.    The stack interprets several manufacturer's statistics with meaning as sent by the Itron RFLAN.  These include statistics between 2048 and 2067.  Please reserve manufacturer's statistics 2048 through 2999 for Itron use in updates to the submission.
  10.   Transport layer maximum payload is 150 bytes.  Application layer can send up to 643 byte messages, including up to 515 bytes of epsem and 128 bytes of ACSE message overhead.
  11.   The receive segmenter can handle at most 10 disjoint application message segments.  Adjacent segments are combined and count as 1.

## 5.0 Build process

The test applications can be built using the included IDE's using Borland C++ 5.02.  We would welcome
